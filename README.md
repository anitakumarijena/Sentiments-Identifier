## Project: Sentiments-Identifier

It analysis the  Sentiment and interpretation and classification of emotions whether it is positive or negative comment with using  text data.
### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Sentiments Identifier.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `imdb_labelled.txt` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Sentiments Identifier.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Sentiments Identifier.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
